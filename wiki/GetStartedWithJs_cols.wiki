= Get started with js_cols =

To get started with the js_cols library, download the latest version from http://code.google.com/p/jscols/downloads/list
Unzip the file and place the js_cols folder in the home folder of your application. Include the file js_cols/base.js in a script tag:
<script src="js_cols/base.js"></script>

This will define the variable js_cols in the global name space. All constructors of the js_cols library are properties of js_cols. Furthermore, the function js_cols.require is defined in the base.js file. This function is used to include the desired classes in your html document like this:
{{{
<script>   
js_cols.require('js_cols.LinkedList'); 
js_cols.require('js_cols.HashMap'); 
</script>
}}}

*It is important that the calls to js_cols.require are placed in their own script tag, which should be closed before writing any code that uses the required parts of the library.* 

==Correct usage:==

{{{
<script src="js_cols/base.js"></script>
<script>   
js_cols.require('js_cols.LinkedList'); 
js_cols.require('js_cols.HashMap'); 
</script>
<script>   
var map = new js_cols.HashMap();
map.insert(something);
..... do work.......
............
</script>
}}}

By using the `js_cols.require` function, dependencies are managed such that classes on which other classes depend, are automatically included. Furthermore redundant inclusions and circular references are avoided.
